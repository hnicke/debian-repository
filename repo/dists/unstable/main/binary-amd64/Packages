Description: Keyboard-driven terminal file navigator and launcher
 Sodalite is a keyboard-driven terminal file navigator and launcher.
 It's designed to be the missing glue for those who use the shell
 as their daily driver and seek more speed and ease.
 In a nutshell, sodalite assigns a key to each entry.
 Pressing a key navigates to the corresponding entry.
 The assignments are permanent but can be changed to your liking.
 .
 Next to fast navigation, sodalite brings file preview
 with syntax highlighting and a pluggable hook system.
 .
 Sodalite is designed as an extension to your shell.
 After installation, don't forget to enable its shell integration.
